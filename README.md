# ElectronicServicesProtection-v2
An application coded using Python which allows a user to view, search, add or remove, and calculate the total amount of the subscribed services. In this version, we have implemented the Electronic Services &amp; Protection (ESP) System using sockets, one which act as the server (file system) and the other to serve as the client (front end).
